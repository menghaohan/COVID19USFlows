<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The efficiency of reducing human mobility and related activities have been proved for containing the transmission of the global public health threat COVID-19 epidemic. 
Most governments have responded with policies such as social distancing, lockdown cities, regional travel restrictions. 
Understanding large scale human mobility patterns is thereby crucial for monitoring and measuring the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic.   
Here, we provide a multiscale mobility flow dataset across the United States since March, 2020.
By tracking anonymous mobile phone users’ trajectories to various places provided by SafeGraph, both daily and weekly dynamic population flows are computed, aggregated, and inferred at three scales including census tract to census tract, county to county, and state to state, respectively.
Results of the comparison between our mobility flow dataset and openly available data sources show high consistency, in which proves the reliability of the data quality. 
Such a high spatio-temporal resolution human mobility flow dataset can not only help monitor real-time epidemic spreading, inform public health policy making, but also deepen our understanding of human behaviors.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Data Processing and Data Descriptor
